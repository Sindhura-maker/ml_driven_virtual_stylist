# ml_driven_virtual_stylist
This project is a *machine-learning based virtual stylist web application* that recommends personalized outfits, colors, accessories, and makeup based on user input. It analyzes *skin tone (via face image), body shape (via measurements), preferences, occasion, weather, comfort, and budget* to suggest the most suitable clothing combinations. The system uses *KNN machine learning* and a *large Kaggle fashion dataset (Fashion Product Images Dataset – styles.csv)* to generate realistic recommendations.

The application applies *rule-based filtering + ML similarity search* to provide smart outfit results. It includes *color palette recommendations, **accessories, **virtual wardrobe support, and **feedback logging* (Like/Dislike) to simulate learning. Users can either upload a face image for automatic skin tone detection or select manually. Measurements are optional, with a backup body shape selection. Finally, results include an *explanation* describing why the outfit is chosen based on occasion, weather, and body features.
